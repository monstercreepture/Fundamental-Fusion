Fundamental Fusion: A Data-Driven Stock Valuation Tool
This repository contains the source code for Fundamental Fusion, a comprehensive tool for automated stock analysis and valuation. The project leverages financial ratios and discounted cash flow modeling to generate a quantitative score for investment evaluation.
Objective
To develop a systematic approach for assessing a company's valuation by performing financial ratio analysis and employing discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation techniques.
Approach
The core of the project is the stockgrader.py script, which automates the process of fetching, analyzing, and scoring stocks based on a wide range of fundamental metrics.
Data Evaluation: Evaluated a universe of over 8,300 stocks using 20+ fundamental metrics, including P/E ratio, ROE, EPS growth quarter-over-quarter, and profit margin.
Sector-Relative Scoring: Analyzed sector-specific metric distributions to determine stock percentiles. This allowed for a fair, peer-to-peer comparison, grading performance on a 100-point scale.
Intrinsic Value Calculation: Utilized discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to determine the company's intrinsic valuation with precision, leveraging financial modeling to project future cash flows.
Result
Successfully created an automated fundamental analysis tool for stock evaluation.
The final output, demonstrated in Stock Ratings.csv, enhances investment evaluations by providing a clear, quantitative, sector-relative score for each stock.
